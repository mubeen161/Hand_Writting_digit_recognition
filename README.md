# Hand Writting digit recognition

The handwritten digit recognition is the capability of computer applications to recognize the human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different shapes and sizes. The handwritten digit recognition system is a way to tackle this
problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image. Convolutional Neural Network model created over the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits .

The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.
It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.
The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.
